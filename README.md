## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass for Styling (SCSS)
- Responsive Design
- CSS Flexbox
- Hover effects and active states
- Google Fonts
- Accessibility (ARIA attributes)

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I’ve improved my skills in semantic HTML5, Sass for scalable styling, and creating responsive, mobile-first designs. I learned how to use Flexbox for layout, implement hover effects, and manage dynamic UI elements like overlays. This project helped me focus on writing clean, accessible, and responsive code for modern web development.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I can further develop my skills by focusing on more advanced CSS techniques like grid layouts and animations to create more complex, responsive designs. I can also dive deeper into accessibility features and improve my understanding of JavaScript to add more interactivity. Additionally, refining my use of version control systems like Git would help streamline collaboration and project management in future challenges.
